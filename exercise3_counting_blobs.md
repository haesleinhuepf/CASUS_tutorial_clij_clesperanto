# Exercise 4: Counting blobs.

Setup a workflow for counting blobs in ImageJ's blobs.gif example image.
Use these functions:
* Gaussian Blur
* Otsu's threshold method
* Connected Component Labeling
* Measure maximum intensity in the resulting label image

In order to achieve this, it is recommended to use the Macro recorder or auto-completion in the script editor.

Optional: Write this script in Fijis Jython or Icy JavaScript. If you use Icy, turn on CLIJs recorder and execute the operations from the menu.
